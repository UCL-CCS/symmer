class S3_projection:
    """
    Base class for enabling qubit reduction techniques derived from
    the Stabilizer SubSpace (S3) projection framework, such as tapering
    and Contextual-Subspace VQE. The methods defined herein serve the
    following purposes:

    - _perform_projection
        Assuming the input operator has been rotated via the Clifford operations
        found in the above stabilizer_rotations method, this will effect the
        projection onto the corresponding stabilizer subspace. This involves
        droping any operator terms that do not commute with the rotated generators
        and fixing the eigenvalues of those that do consistently.
    - perform_projection
        This method wraps _perform_projection but provides the facility to insert
        auxiliary rotations (that need not be Clifford). This is used in CS-VQE
        to implement unitary partitioning where necessary.

    Attributes:
        rotated_flag (bool): If True, the operator is rotated. By default it is set to 'False'.

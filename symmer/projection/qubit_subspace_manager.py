class QubitSubspaceManager:
    """
    Class for automating the following qubit subspace techqniques:

    *** QubitTapering ***
    - Maps each Z2-symmetry onto distinct qubits and projects over them
    - Yields an exact reduction, given that the correct sector is identifed

    *** ContextualSubspace ***
    - Partitions the Hamiltonian into noncontextual and contextual components
    - The noncontextual problem may be solved via classical optimization
    - We then impose noncontextual symmetries over the contextual portion of
      the Hamiltonian, constrained by the noncontextual solution
    - Allows one to define a reduced Hamiltonian of any size but incurs error

    It is recommended that the user should specify a reference state,
    such as Hartree-Fock. Otherwise, Symmer will try to identify an
    alternative refernce, either via direct diagonalization  if the
    Hamiltonian is sufficiently small, or using a DMRG calculation.

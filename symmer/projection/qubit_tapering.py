    """
    Class for performing qubit tapering as per https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08213.
    Reduces the number of qubits in the problem whilst preserving its energy spectrum by:

    1. identifying a symmetry of the Hamiltonian,
    2. finding an independent basis therein,
    3. rotating each basis operator onto a single Pauli X,
    4. dropping the corresponding qubits from the Hamiltonian whilst
    5. fixing the +/-1 eigenvalues

    Steps 1-2 are handled in this class whereas we defer to the parent S3_projection for 3-5.
